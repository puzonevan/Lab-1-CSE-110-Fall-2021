# Evan Puzon


## Who Am I
I tend to stray off standard norms often and that begins with the pronounciation of my name. My name is **Evan(eee-von)**. However, in the past, I would mess with my teachers and see how long it takes them to figure out that my name is pronounced that way and not how it is usually pronounced(eh-vin). *Anyways, Who Am I?* I am a **Third Year Computer Science Major** here at **UCSD** aspiring to finish by end of this year. 

I would start listing out what my experiences are, what programming languages I know, and my hobbies, but let's start with a quote from the wisest man in all of television, Uncle Iroh: 

> "Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not"
