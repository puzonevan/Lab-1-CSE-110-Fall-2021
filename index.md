# Evan Puzon


## Who Am I
I tend to stray off standard norms often and that begins with the pronounciation of my name. My name is **Evan(eee-von)**. However, in the past, I would mess with my teachers and see how long it takes them to figure out that my name is pronounced that way and not how it is usually pronounced(eh-vin). ***Anyways, Who Am I?*** I am a **Third Year Computer Science Major** here at **UCSD** aspiring to finish by end of this year. 

I would start listing out what my experiences are, what programming languages I know, and my hobbies, but let's start with a quote from the wisest man in all of television, Uncle Iroh:

## How to Code? 
As a Computer Science major, I think I can code lol.

### Here's some HTML/CSS/JS
```
<h1 id="scream">YAHHHOOOOOO</h1>

h1{
    color: red;
    font-size: 100px;
    text-align: center;
}

document.getElementById("scream").addEventListener("click", () =>{
    console.log("AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH");
});
